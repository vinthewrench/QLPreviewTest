# QLPreviewTest

QLPreviewTest is a IOS app that tests simple functionality of QLPreviewController.
there are some bugs introduced in ios 11 that seem to effect the QLPreviewController
depending on whether the files are located in the App mainbundle directory or 
possibly in the NSCachesDirectory.

This app optionally allows testing the use of the QLPreviewController when displaying within a subview.
